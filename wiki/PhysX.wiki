lib/PhysicsSDKs/Physics/include<br>
lib/PhysicsSDKs/PhysicsLoader/include<br>


Step 2: MORE DEPENDENCIES

Append the following to the additional dependencies on the project

PhysXLoader.lib<br>
PhysXCore.lib<br>

Step 3: NEW LIBRARY DIRECTORIES

Under  Linker -> General there is a cell for Additional Library Directories, the following need to be added

lib/win32<br>
lib/PhysicsSDKs/lib/Win32<br>

Step 4: A PREPROCESSER DEFINE

Under c/c++ -> Preprocessor in the cell Prepocessor Defenitions include a WIN32 define

WIN32

Step 5: SYSTEM32 FILES

If the program is not working at this point you need to copy a few dll files to the Windows/System32 folder, you need to copy the following

lib/win32/PhysXCore.dll<br>
lib/win32/PhysXLoader.dll<br>
