Minutes:

The meeting began with an unofficial motion from Matt that owing to comlpexity of civilization portion of PZP,
	focus should change to the ship combat system.
Motion carried unanimously.

Combat has the following dependencies:
	System - the solar system combat takes place in...affects movement, shields, fleets in attendance, etc.
	Planet - location of combat.  Considered a ship with no movement.
	Ship - the space vessels engaged in combat.
		Tech - Technology
		Race - grants bonuses to combat
			Player - who controls what ships.
		Leader - grants bonuses to combat
			-considered: All ships inherently have a leader to facilitate experience gain and
					a second leader slot for hired leaders.
		Diplomacy - Considered and approved: Allies of those in combat can take part in combat as well.


Ship class
	Engines - movement
		adds bonus to defense
	Shield
		four separate shields:
			bow
			aft
			starboard
			port
	Armor
	Structure
	System
	Attack
		Beam
			accuracy
			dmg
	Specials: Specials affect all systems and are highest tier before calculating dmg given and received.


Beam: child of weapon
	Damage variable is a range between min and max damage
	damage is calculated:
		dmg=min+(%max-%range)
		it was later decided Special will be the final tier in calculating dmg given.


Boarding:
	Considered: Taking control of captured ship possible even if no telepathy
		After x turns a system would be activated for use by capturing force.
		After 2x turns, another system would be activated and so on.
		Technologies would impact the value of x.
		The systems come online in this order:
			Engines
			Shields
			following not decided.  Perhaps systems would come on first.


Attack Phase of combat:

	calculateHit();
	if (hit)
	{
		calculateHitDmg();
		applyHitDmg();
	}
	else
		sorry, you missed

applyHitDmg()
{
//damage applied is affected by type of weapon and specials applied.  Some might only affect systems, some bypass shields, or armor etc.
	Shields
	Armor
	Structure
	Systems
}

-------------------------------------------

Next Step:
Matt will work on building interface, space combat map, etc.
Taylor and Alan will work together to flesh out Beam weapon specifics.

Next Meeting:
1100 Saturday, 9 October 2010

Meeting closed at 1155.
